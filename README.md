### Introduction

Introduce your project briefly, explaining its purpose and the problem it aims to solve. Highlight its unique features or benefits.

### Features

List the key features of your project:

- Skin detection using YCrCb color space.
- Contour analysis for jaundice symptom detection.
- Real-time webcam feed analysis.
- SMS notifications using Twilio.
- Control of external devices via serial communication.

### Prerequisites

Detail any prerequisites or dependencies users need to have installed or set up before running your script. Include links or instructions for where to obtain these dependencies if necessary.

### Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up your project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bharath2228/Automation-of-Phototherapy-for-Neonatal-Jaundice-Detection.git
   ```

2. Configure Twilio API credentials:
   - Sign up for Twilio and obtain your Account SID, Auth Token, and Twilio phone number.
   - Replace placeholders in the script (`# twilio Account ID`, `# Authorization Token`, `from_='----------'`, `to='----------'`) with your actual Twilio credentials.

3. Configure serial communication:
   - Adjust the `port` (`e.port = "COM9"`) to match your serial port.
   - Modify baudrate (`e.baudrate = 115200`) if required.

### Usage

Explain how to use your project:

- Run `jaundice_detection.py`.
- Ensure the webcam is correctly positioned and lighting conditions are suitable for accurate detection.
- Monitor the console for detection results and status updates.
- Respond to SMS notifications sent by the script.

### Troubleshooting

Provide troubleshooting tips for common issues users might encounter, such as:

- Webcam not detected.
- Incorrect Twilio credentials.
- Serial communication errors.

### Example

Here's an example of how your `README.md` file might look with these additional sections:

# Jaundice Detection and Notification System

This project utilizes computer vision techniques to detect jaundice in captured images or video feed from a webcam. It then sends notifications via SMS using Twilio and controls an external device (via serial communication) based on the detection results.

## Introduction

Jaundice is a common condition in infants and adults, characterized by yellowing of the skin and eyes due to elevated bilirubin levels in the blood. This system aims to assist in early detection and prompt notification for timely medical intervention.

## Features

- Skin detection using YCrCb color space.
- Contour analysis for jaundice symptom detection.
- Real-time webcam feed analysis.
- SMS notifications using Twilio.
- Control of external devices via serial communication.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
- cvzone (`pip install cvzone`)
- Twilio (`pip install twilio`)

Ensure you have a webcam connected and configured properly. You also need valid Twilio API credentials for SMS notifications and a compatible serial device for external control.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bharath2228/Automation-of-Phototherapy-for-Neonatal-Jaundice-Detection.git
   cd Automation-of-Phototherapy-for-Neonatal-Jaundice-Detection
   ```

2. Configure Twilio API credentials:
   - Sign up for Twilio and obtain your Account SID, Auth Token, and Twilio phone number.
   - Replace placeholders in the script (`# twilio Account ID`, `# Authorization Token`, `from_='----------'`, `to='----------'`) with your actual Twilio credentials.

3. Configure serial communication:
   - Adjust the `port` (`e.port = "COM9"`) to match your serial port.
   - Modify baudrate (`e.baudrate = 115200`) if required.

## Usage

- Run `jaundice_detection.py`.
- Ensure the webcam is correctly positioned and lighting conditions are suitable for accurate detection.
- Monitor the console for detection results and status updates.
- Respond to SMS notifications sent by the script.

## Troubleshooting

- **Webcam not detected:** Check webcam connections and drivers.
- **Twilio credentials incorrect:** Verify Twilio Account SID, Auth Token, and phone numbers.
- **Serial communication issues:** Ensure correct port and baudrate settings.
